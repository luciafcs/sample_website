  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

  <p>
   
   leader in the movement to teach
    <em> <strong>sophistication</em> </strong>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We believe there are <strong>least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim-Berners-Lee">Tim-Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true
    that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
     on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
     interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the

    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
     Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
     at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
     tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
